Fake News Detection:
Fake news detection is the process of identifying and classifying news articles, social media posts, or other forms of content as either real or fake using various techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning. The goal is to prevent misinformation from spreading and ensure the reliability of information consumed by the public.

Key Components of Fake News Detection:
Data Collection: Gathering datasets containing real and fake news articles for training and evaluation.
Text Processing: Using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF, word embeddings) to analyze text content.
Feature Extraction: Identifying linguistic patterns, sentiment, readability scores, and source credibility.
Model Training: Implementing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, and deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) to classify news as real or fake.
Evaluation & Deployment: Testing model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and deploying the model for real-world applications.
